#####EVENTS
 carto.1.test:0 "Great Fire of Carthage"
 carto.1.desc:0 "The usually busy port of Carthage was burning, flame and screams rising with the smoke.\nThe fire started from before midday and lasted until the night brought a fortunate rain, a sign from God, some say.\nThe port was heavily damaged but not impossibile to repair, as many nobles have offered to loan the required coinage to fix the damage, there is still the question of 'Who did it?'.\nFor the moment the only suspect are the Indictian faithful that still reside in the city, maybe we should charge the carpenters to them?\nOr as the good King, I will personally pay for the repairs."
 carto.1a:0 "Make the Indictians pay for it."
 carto.1b:0 "Ask the Nobility to pay the repairs."
 carto.1c:0 "Reach out of the Royal Treasury."

 carto.2.test:0 "Trial of Faith"
 carto.2.desc:0 "It's unclear how exactly the fire started, while many are quick to blame the Indictians, the truth is that the clerical tension have reached a boiling point that only a direct order from the king is necessary.\nThe local leader of the Indictian clergy has petitioned the court to create a trial for the possible suspects, claimint to have found the arsonist but demanding a fair judgement.\nOn the other side, the Imperial Envoy has urged the complete conversion of the populace to the Lucanian Church or the Emperor may reconsider our Electorate position.\nThe choice is not one taken lightly, consider the options, my liege."
 carto.2a:0 "Crack down on the infedels."
 carto.2b:0 "Set up a proper Trial."

 carto.3.test:0 "Mercy of the Clergy"
 carto.3.desc:0 "The Lucanian Church has sent the court an envoy.\n'Cease the senseless oppression of our brethren in faith!'\nThe cost of proper governance with the Indictians and the Catholics have taken a toll on the population, leading many to simply leave for more tolerant countries, however we are just in time to mend our action and mercyful reinstate the heretics."
 carto.3a:0 "Mercy is for the True Faithful."
 carto.3b:0 "Assume the burden of Apology."

 carto.4.test:0 "Trials and Tribulations"
 carto.4.desc:0 "During the trial, standing in front of the King, instead of a chained miscreant, a mob of Indictian men and African agitators has gathered and overwhelmed the royal guards.\nAlthough the King has been captured and the news has reached the shores, only a few nobles have raised their levies and prepared an attack against us.\nThey will see the might of Carthage, returned from the ashes of the sea and the spirit of it's people!"
 carto.4a:0 "Carthago Revertitura!"

 carto.5.test:0 "Reborn in Flame"
 carto.5.desc:0 "As the people run through the streets of the city, the Indictian clergy takes charge of organising the resistance and the war against the old nobles.\nEventually the clergy will mediate the various factions that remain in the country, consolidating the institutions into the new Carthaginian Republic."
 carto.5a:0 "The Republic Reborn in Flames."

 carto.6.test:0 "Revenge, Thousand Years in the Making"
 carto.6.desc:0 ""
 carto.6a:0 "Retribution for the Past and the Future."
 carto.6b:0 "Roma Delenda Est."
