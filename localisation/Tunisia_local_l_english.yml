 carto.1.test:0 "The Great Fire of [341.GetName]"
 carto.1.desc:0 "A tragedy has struck [341.GetName] as an unfortunate warehouse accident caused a fire to spiral out of control, leading to a raging inferno engulfing the city! It burned the whole day, and resulted in the destruction of most of the city's buildings, leaving our nation now economically destitute. The fire has lead to increased tension between the Catholics and Indictians in our nation, as they blame each other for the disastrous fire. This event shall shape our nation for years to come, and time will tell what comes of this."
 carto.1a:0 "Oh no!"

 carto.2.test:0 "Trial of Faith"
 carto.2.desc:0 "It's unclear how exactly the fire started. While many are quick to blame the Indictians, the truth is that the clerical tension has reached a boiling point that necessitates a direct order from the king. The local leader of the Indictian clergy has petitioned the court to create a trial for the possible suspects, claiming to have found the arsonist but demanding a fair judgement. On the other side, the Imperial Envoy has urged the complete conversion of the populace to the Lucanian Church; otherwise, the Emperor may reconsider our Electorate position. The choice is not one taken lightly. Consider the options, my liege."
 carto.2a:0 "Crack down on the infidels."
 carto.2b:0 "Set up a proper trial."

 carto.3.test:0 "Mercy of the Clergy"
 carto.3.desc:0 "The Lucanian Church has sent the court an envoy.\n'Cease the senseless oppression of our brethren in faith!'\nThe cost of proper governance with the Indictians and the Catholics have taken a toll on the population, leading many to simply leave for more tolerant countries; however, we are just in time to mend our action and mercifully reinstate the heretics."
 carto.3a:0 "Mercy is for the true faithful."
 carto.3b:0 "Assume the burden of apology."

 carto.4.test:0 "Trials and Tribulations"
 carto.4.desc:0 "During the trial, standing in front of the King, instead of a chained miscreant, a mob of Indictian men and African agitators has gathered and overwhelmed the royal guards.\nAlthough the King has been captured and the news has reached the shores, only a few nobles have raised their levies and prepared an attack against us.\nThey will see the might of Carthage, returned from the ashes of the sea and the spirit of it's people!"
 carto.4a:0 "Carthago Revertitura!"

 carto.5.test:0 "Reborn in Flame"
 carto.5.desc:0 "As the people run through the streets of the city, the Indictian clergy takes charge of organising the resistance and the war against the old nobles.\nEventually the clergy will mediate the various factions that remain in the country, consolidating the institutions into the new Carthaginian Republic."
