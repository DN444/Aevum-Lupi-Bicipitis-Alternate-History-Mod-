 rhom.2.test:0 "Shattered Dreams"
 rhom.2.desc:0 "The crusaders destroyed many temple and churches, burned down libraries and killed innocent believers.\nThe Legions can no longer fight these invanding infedels and must return home to recover, hopefully many have learned not to take their position for granted as God and Emperor do not take lightly to cowards."

 rhom.3.test:0 "Mad Sands Rebellion"

 rhom.1000.test:0 "The Pirate's Due"
 rhom.1000.desc:0 "The conquest of Cyprus was a clever one, a few ships and a well paid captain, and the island was no longer in the hands of the Italians, however  our ability to defend it is limited.\nThe same captain offered to protect the island for the governship of it, while at the time we had accepted, we have to ensure the loyalty of the pirates."
 rhom.1000a:0 "Pay you taxes!"
