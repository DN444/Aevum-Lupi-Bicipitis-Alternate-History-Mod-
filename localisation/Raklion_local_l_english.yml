 rakl.1.test:0 "Raklionne Dominance over the Straits"
 rakl.1.desc:0 "With little celebration, the last Maurian holdouts along the Pillars of Hercules fell, and our dominance was assured. This move has increased our flow of revenue greatly and it has reached us that a change in trade policy is necessary. With our hegemony over anything entering or leaving the middle sea, we can either choose to pursue a policy of long-term gains or immediately raise the tariffs."
 rakl.1a:0 "Go for the safe move."

A growing idea of a unified identity, the people of the straits of Herkules, finding themselves in communion with each other more than outsiders. From this unified identity we will forge a nation out of the straits, a truly Herkulean nation."
