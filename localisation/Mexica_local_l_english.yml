#####EVENT

 mexic.2.test:0 "The Wheel of Innovation"
 mexic.2.desc:0 "Rivers go one way.\nTrade goes two ways.\nA transaction of goods or currency, if done correctly both parties gain what they want, if done better you gain more than you need.\nThe Northern Lakes have brought us the ideas to change our society, mold it and progress it to higher heights."
 mexic.2a:0 "The Old Ways go Away."

 mexic.3.test:0 "Champion of the Atloyac"
 mexic.3.desc:0 "As the Mexica people expand and grows, many try to find fortune in taking new lands.\nSome are better than others in how they do it: some buy it, some take empty land and start farming and some simply pick up an axe and goes conquering.\nOur great Tlatoque has been proposed by many to get sponsored in their endeavours, however only one of them has peaked our interest."
 mexic.3a:0 "Create more Trading Settlements near the Lakes."
 mexic.3b:0 "Settle the Plains near the middle Atloyac."
 mexic.3c:0 "Grant him command over the Aztecah troops."

 mexic.4.test:0 "Call of the North"
 mexic.4.desc:0 "The pale ones, the golden warriors of light, however they call themselves in their own language, have helped us through trade and protection to enstablish a foothold over the Great Lakes.\nThey are capable of forging with more durable metals and travel great distances on open waters, but they lack the knowledge of these lands and lack the food production necessary to sustain themselve.\nAs everything has a cost, we have assisted them and now they repay us the favor."
 mexic.4a:0 "Allow some Pale Ones to inhabit our lands."
 mexic.4b:0 "Use them to scare the neighbors into submission."

 mexic.5.test:0 "Treaties of Friendship"
 mexic.5.desc:0 "As the nomadic peoples that pass through our lands have done since years past, they have been compeled to pass without too much harvestign of resources.\nSometimes this has led to small skirmish, victories and losses that left both sides in worse conditions than before.\nHowever, this time, the situation is quite different.\nTwo tribes have requested to join the Federation, but they won't allow the other to join, citing former problems and a shared complicated history.\nWho we will allow in, maybe neither?"
 mexic.5a:0 "To the East, from where we came."
 mexic.5b:0 "To the West, from where the future lies."
 mexic.5c:0 "Unbury the Hatchet."

 mexic.6.test:0 "Friends to the West"
 mexic.6.desc:0 "As time passes, the culture of our western friends has become more entwined."
 mexic.6a:0 "Icniuh, our friends."

 mexic.7.test:0 "Friends to the East"
 mexic.7.desc:0 "As time passes, the culture of our eastern friends has become more entwined."
 mexic.7a:0 "Icniuh, our friends."

 mexic.8.test:0 "The Great Wasting"
 mexic.8.desc:0 "Like fog gently sweeps through the landscape, so do the people from the Sea, covering every coastline with their tiny wooded villages and their tradeposts.\nLike rain brings both good and bad omens, the Sea People have brought the Great Wasting.\nA sickness spreads from where they land and when it reaches a village, those too weak, die.\nThe Mexica have begun to pray ever more to stop this wave of death."
 mexic.8a:0 "Let the Gods decide."

 mexic.9.test:0 "The Wasting Encroaches"
 mexic.9.desc:0 "The village was empty.\nDecried a scout, his blue eyes full of terror.\nIt wasn't the first and won't be the last.\nBut there is little to do, unless great resources are used to safeguard the population that remains."
 mexic.9a:0 "Those who survive shall leave the dead behind."
 mexic.9b:0 "We will not fade away."

 mexic.10.test:0 "The Hand that Helped"
 mexic.10.desc:0 "The People from the Sea have prepared their best medics and shamans to the rescue of our population.\nRealizing that a local ally would be preferable to empty ruins and fragmented squabbling tribes, they have helped us through these times of great crisis.\nAlthough our new friends have yet to decide how we could repay them, our great Tlatoque has united the surviving nobles and Aztecah warriors to decide the future of our nation after the devastation that has passed."
 mexic.10a:0 "The Lord of Light saved us."
 mexic.10b:0 "The Lord of the Cross saved us."
 mexic.10c:0 "The Lord of the Cross saved us."
 mexic.10d:0 "Bless be the Rains."

 mexic.11.test:0 "The Hands that Bled"
 mexic.11.desc:0 "Surviving the Great Wasting wasn't a choice, it was a matter of superiority.\nThe Mexica Federation would not be so easily broken by a meagre curse, we remained strong through the storm brought by the Sea People.\nNot a coincidence that one of their merchants would leave one village, only for that village to die shortly after.\nWe will make them pay!"
 mexic.11a:0 "Beat the Devils with our own bare hands!"
 mexic.11b:0 "Unbroken we Remain!"

 mexic.12.test:0 "The Greed of the Heart"
 mexic.12.desc:0 "As the trade with the Europeans expands, so does the demand for cotton and other goods.\nThe current production has been handled by our workers, but the Europeans request more than we can produce and many of our merchants and land owners want to meet those demands.\nSome have bought slaves from the Iberians, which allowed them to gain more coins and sway in internal politics."
 mexic.12a:0 "Like the Iberians, we need more hands to work."
 mexic.12b:0 "We share the same Burdens."

 mexic.13.test:0 "The Vinlandic Decree on Freedom"
 mexic.13.desc:0 "During the years between 1680 and 1700, the Vinlandics have had several debates on their own slavery and indentured servitude, ending with a royal decree of liberation of any slaves or goods produced by slavery.\nThis extended to every other country exports in Vinland, which made a big part of our trade income simply dissapear over night.\nThe solution was simple: end slavery; however any slave owner would recieve a payment to release their slaves, to ensure no resentment against the goverment.\nUnfortunately for the slaves, the situation didn't necesseraly mean that they would be treated much better than before."
 mexic.13a:0 "It's not Illegal, if you change the laws."

 mexic.14.test:0 "The Rebellious Lot"
 mexic.14.desc:0 "As time passes and history is written, many plead to our mercyful lord to ensure proper working condition to those who are destitute and not free.\nAs slavers and slaves fight and die, those of the law and power watch to decide who is free and who is in chains."
 mexic.14a:0 "Let them riot, they will stop eventually."
 mexic.14b:0 "Ensure the owner's safety."
 mexic.14c:0 "Let them retain apart of the profits."
 mexic.14d:0 "Send in the Aztecah."
 mexic.14e:0 "Give them a little freedom."

 mexic.15.test:0 "The Treaty of Friendship"
 mexic.15.desc:0 "Since the times our warriors first reached the mouth of the Nyfljot and ventured into the hinterland of Rausulia, we have had great trouble comunicating and trading with the locals.\nBerserker made for bad first impression and raids made worse last impressions.\nHowever, past the great Lakes, the Mexica have been great trade partners and helped us deal with our stronger neighbors.\nTrade flourished and even exchange of population were made to fortify our alliance, but now the Tlatoque of the Mexica has proposed a true Treaty of Friendship, everlasting and built on mutual support."
 mexic.15a:0 "Put it to Stone."
 mexic.15b:0 "What a dumb idea."

 mexic.19.test:0 "The Aztecah Demand Order"
 mexic.19.desc:0 "The power of Tlatoque is waning and local nobility has been encroaching on the fleeting law and order to sieze more power for themselves.\nOf all of them, the elite Aztecah are the only ones with the arms and manpower to actually break the hold of the Tlatoque, but they do not have enough sway at the moment to achieve anything.\nWe will conserve our way of life with freedom of trade and mobility."
 mexic.19a:0 "With thunderous applause!"

 mexic.20.test:0 "The Azteki Mandate"
 mexic.20.desc:0 "The Aztecah have finally took over the old Tlatoque's palace and are waiting for the Tlatoque to reliquish his power.\nHowever the Tlatoque still has enough power and monetary reach to stop the Aztecah before they sieze control over the nation."
 mexic.20a:0 "My New Empire!"
 mexic.20b:0 "Let Freedom Ring!"

 mexic.21.test:0 "The Book and The Word"
 mexic.21.desc:0 "The Mexica nation has grown large and the new population needs to be educated in the culture and history of their forefathers.\nThe Tlatoque has issued particular topics to bring and those to never speak about.\nHowever the teaching of languages has been debated heavily in the higher circles.\nThose suggesting that all kind of thoughts and ideas should be taught are a small minority, but many have had preference for certain tounges for easier trade and better relations, like Vinland and Raklen."
 mexic.21a:0 "Focus on our history!"
 mexic.21b:0 "The Light's ones deserve a spot in history."
 mexic.21a:0 "The Iberians have helped us and we will remember."
 mexic.21b:0 "Both! Both is good."

 mexic.22.test:0 "The People of the Northern Light"
 mexic.22.desc:0 "Our friend of the Great Lakes, the Vinlandic people have been under our rules for years and, while they remain a distinct culture, they have been influenced to join our cause and our nation."
 mexic.22a:0 "Two doomed worlds to make our new one."

 mexic.23.test:0 "The People of the Cross"
 mexic.23.desc:0 "Our friend of the Great Sea, the Raklen people have been under our rules for years and, while they remain a distinct culture, they have been influenced to join our cause and our nation."
 mexic.23a:0 "Let them pray, or who knows what they'll do."

 mexic.24.test:0 "The Lake's Masters"
 mexic.24.desc:0 "As we have expanded in the areas around the Lakes, the tribes and people of the region have been influenced to join our cause and our nation."
 mexic.24a:0 "Trade, not War."
