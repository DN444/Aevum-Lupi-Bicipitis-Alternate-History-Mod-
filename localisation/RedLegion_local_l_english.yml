 redleg.1.desc:0 "The first Crusade proved to be a mere pyrrhic victory, only securing the safety of the coptic faith in Alexandria and the rest of Egypt.\nThe second Crusade was less effective and didn't last that many years before being called off because of a Plague.\nThe third Crusade was a complete disaster, many noble families were slain and the Indictian faith lost most of it's power.\nWith the fall of Africa and the power vacuum left, it is our only hope to riunify and beat the muslim hold on the holy land, we shall march on a Fourth Crusade!"

 redleg.11.desc:0 "As the continuos struggles to govern an actual country, instead of a army of zealous knights, has showed $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ that a change in pace may prove more beneficial to all.\nBut what should we strive for, what is our purpose, how can we secure a future for the citizens of our country while both protecting them from external threats?"
