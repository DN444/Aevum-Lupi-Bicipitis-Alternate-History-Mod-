 hussite.1.d:0 "A growing pacifist movement is taking hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] Wycliffians and has even been endorsed to some extent by the state.

It has become a popular spectacle among bored [Root.GetAdjective] urbanites."
 hussite.5.a:0 "It is the [Root.GetAdjective] way."
 hussite.6.t:0 "Utraquists and Taborites"
 hussite.6.d:0 "Though it was the moderate Utraquists that triumphed in the Wycliffian Wars, the resurgence of the Wycliffian faith throughout [Root.GetName] has led to the resurfacing of radical Taborite sects.

 hussite.6.b:0 "Support the Utraquists."
 hussite.7.t:0 "War Wagons"
 hussite.7.d:0 "War wagons were employed to great effect during the Wycliffian Wars.
