#####EVENTS

 hun.1.test:0 "Our Father's Father and their Son's Sons"
 hun.1.desc:0 "After a thousand years of in western Europe, settling our own small kingdom in the ashes of the old Roman Empire, we aim to reconcile our own traditions and practices with those of the people we have conquered.\nAlthough we have germanic subjects, a fair few of them claim to be a different kind, 'Francine', which of these could garner us the diplomatic reach we need to expand our reign."
 hun.1a:0 "The Teutons and the Huns broke an Empire, now we forge one together!"
 hun.1b:0 "These up-starts have the Gaul to take on the Soxons!"
 hun.1c:0 "We are the Scourge of God!"

 hun.2.test:0 "The Great Fire of Rome"
 hun.2.desc:0 "While our great Horde was stopped at the Rhine by the Soxons, we have not forgotten that the goal of the great Attila was the city of Rome itself, to stop the power of the Romans and break their spirit.\nForge an empire out of its ashes and strive forward with the power of Huns!\nBurn the Eternal City and break the Papal Power forever!"
 hun.2a:0 "Break every brick and leave only ashes behind!"
 hun.2b:0 "The Eternal Fire from the Eternal City shall bring forward the End of the World!"
 hun.2c:0 "Ensure the power of the Pope and any future 'Roman' empire is standing on a broken pedestal!"

 hun.3.test:0 "Soxon's Sorrow"
 hun.3.desc:0 "The bastard sons of the Soxons have stopped the great Attila on the Rehin River, but now we have taken our revenge.\nDriven them away from their 'imperial' capital and what left to do is break it, or maybe use it in a way they will absolutely hate!"
 hun.3a:0 "Enstablish our new capital on theirs, we shall make it better!"
 hun.3b:0 "Brick by Brick, we will take every marbles and statues."
 hun.3c:0 "Ashes by Ashes, we will take every marbles and statues."
 hun.3d:0 "They will know to fear us!"
