He was his fathers primary tactician and general. However, he was also a follower of zoroaster.\nHe was introduced to the faith when he was 18, while he was touring the city of tabriz. He fell ill and, while lying near-death in bed, he recieved a vision of Ahura Mazda and was cured the next day. From then on he secretly began practicing his faith, as he had to hide it from the muslim court of his father. Alexandros's ambitions are large, and it will be up to fate to see if he shall be successful"

They were captured, and executed on orders of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], so as to not pose a threat to royal power.
