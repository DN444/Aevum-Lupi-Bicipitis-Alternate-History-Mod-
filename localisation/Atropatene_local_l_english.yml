 atro.3.test:0 "The Rule of Alexandros Pamphilos"
 atro.3.desc:0 "Alexander.\nA name truly befitting of a conquerer.\nA fitting name for the young Alexandros.\nFrom a young age, he showed great marshal prowess, even leading armies when he was 17. He was his fathers primary tactician and general. However, he was also a follower of zoroaster.\nHe was introduced to the faith when he was 18, while he was touring the city of tabriz. He fell ill and, while lying near-death in bed, he recieved a vision of Ahura Mazda and was cured the next day. From then on he secretly began practicing his faith, as he had to hide it from the muslim court of his father.

They were captured, and executed on orders of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], so as to not pose a threat to royal power. Greek settlers are already moving into the nearly-abandoned city, with soldiers claiming buildings and aristocrats moving in to the many luxurious palaces"

 atro.5.test:0 "Greece Recovered"
 atro.5.desc:0 "At last, the ancient Hellenic homeland of Greece stands once again under Greek control. Our soldiers parade through the cities of Thessaloniki and Athens and the people cheer. However, we find those people cheering in Turkish, Cuman, and Kolmejar. They practice strange customs all while trying to emulate the ancient Greeks of the cities they inhabit. We must decide whether to live and let live, and to leave them to their own culture, or to enforce Hellenizatiom on them, to restore Greek culture to the ancient cradle of the Hellenic people, and all of western civilization"
 atro.5a:0 "Enforce Hellenization"
 atro.5b:0 "It is their land now, let them be"

 atro.6.test:0 "Greek or Persian"
 atro.6.desc:0 "We are Hellenes. That fact is true, and unchanging. However, we have lived in Persia for many generations now, and some people are starting to consider themselves Persians as well as Greeks. On the contrar, however, many of our Persian subjects are starting to adopt Greek traditions and have begun to call themselves Hellenes. We must truly decide what kind of nation we will be, and what our culture shall be"
