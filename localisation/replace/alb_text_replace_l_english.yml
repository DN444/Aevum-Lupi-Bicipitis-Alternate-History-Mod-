It has become a popular spectacle among bored [Root.GetAdjective] urbanites."

 hussite.6.t:0 "Utraquists and Askanierists"
 hussite.6.d:0 "Though it was the moderate Utraquists that triumphed in the Wycliffian Wars, the resurgence of the Wycliffian faith throughout [Root.GetName] has led to the resurfacing of radical Askanierist sects.

Many of our commanders are Orphans, veterans of the Wycliffian Wars, and wish to make this tactic into official military doctrine."
