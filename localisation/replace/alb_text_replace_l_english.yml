 first_hussite_tt:0 "§YThis option can lead towards peaceful reconciliation with the Wycliffians or a resurgent Wycliffian movement.§!"
 hussite.1.t:0 "Pacifists Object to the War"
 hussite.1.d:0 "A growing pacifist movement is taking hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] Wycliffians and has even been endorsed to some extent by the state. Despite this we find ourselves in a war of aggression. While we surely had excellent reasons to attack, the pacifists take issue with the war and are refusing to fight."
 hussite.1.a:0 "We will respect their beliefs."
 hussite.1.b:0 "All who are called must serve."
 hussite.2.t:0 "Blessed are the Peacemakers"
 hussite.2.d:0 "Years of peace have fostered the growth of a pacifist movement within the Wycliffian faith in [Root.GetName]. [Root.pacifist_theologian.GetName], a respected pacifist theologian, as spoken out to the people in support of our benevolent regime and urges all true Christians to follow the righteous example of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 hussite.2.a:0 "We are all children of God."
 hussite.3.t:0 "Vows of Poverty"
 hussite.3.d:0 "Many Wycliffian sects reject the hoarding of clerical wealth, associating it with the sinful decadence of the Catholic Church. Vows of poverty among priests are becoming common and the [Root.GetAdjective] Church is increasingly confining itself to spiritual matters and refraining from interfering in temporal matters of state or land."
 hussite.3.a:0 "Encourage clerical vows."
 hussite.3.b:0 "There are merits to a powerful Church."
 hussite.4.t:0 "Sinful Noble"
 hussite.4.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Church believes that nobody, regardless of wealth or status, is beyond the laws of god. All who sin must be punished accordingly.\n\n[Root.sinful_noble.GetName] has publicly and shamelessly committed the sin of [Root.GetRandom_Sin], grievously offending the clergy and prompting calls for punishment."
 hussite.4.a:0 "None are above the laws of God."
 hussite.4.b:0 "Make the punishment purely symbolic."
 hussite.5.t:0 "Defenestrations"
 hussite.5.d:0 "Defenestration has been the standard method of execution in [Root.GetName] ever since the resurgence of the Wycliffians. Crowds gather to gawk at criminals as they are flung from a window and fall from a great height to their deaths on the streets below. It has become a popular spectacle among bored [Root.GetAdjective] urbanites."
 hussite.5.a:0 "It is the [Root.GetAdjective] way."
 hussite.6.t:0 "Utraquists and Askanierists"
 hussite.6.d:0 "Though it was the moderate Utraquists that triumphed in the Wycliffian Wars, the resurgence of the Wycliffian faith throughout [Root.GetName] has led to the resurfacing of radical Askanierist sects. They seek to abolish all forms of theological authority besides the Biblical scriptures and to reject Catholic influences to the greatest possible degree. Utraquist leaders have appealed to the state to quell their growing influence."
 hussite.6.a:0 "Embrace the Askanierists."
 hussite.6.b:0 "Support the Utraquists."
 hussite.7.t:0 "War Wagons"
 hussite.7.d:0 "War wagons were employed to great effect during the Wycliffian Wars. As the Wycliffian armies were composed largely of peasant infantry and had little cavalry of their own to bring to the field, war wagons provided a solid defence against cavalry charges from better equipped enemies. Many of our commanders are Orphans, veterans of the Wycliffian Wars, and wish to make this tactic into official military doctrine."
 hussite.7.a:0 "War wagons have served us well before."
 hussite.7.b:0 "We should field more cavalry instead."
 hussite_regency_tt:0 "Has had the event Return of the Wycliffians"
 become_hussite_title:0 "Adopt Wycliffianism"
 become_hussite_desc:0 "The teachings of Jon Wycliff have spread to our nation, and many among the common people are receptive to his word. Denounced as a heresy by the Pope, adopting this faith would put us at odds with most of Christendom. Yet with righteousness in our hearts, we may overcome even the greatest foe."
