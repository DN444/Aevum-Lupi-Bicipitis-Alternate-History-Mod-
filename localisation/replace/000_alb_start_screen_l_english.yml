alb_starting_string_generic: "The greater European world in [GetYear] is on the verge of the §YAge of Discovery§!, finally pulling away from the centuries of stagnation that have preceded this momentous era.\n\nIn Italia, the §YHoly Italian Empire§! reigns, however decentralized. It shall face many challenges ahead, though.\n\nIn the east, the §YRhoman§! eagle still soars over the near east, but it has now been joined by the Islamic crescent. As militant crusaders from the §YRed Legion§! prepare for the §R4th Crusade§!, who knows what shall become of the lands of the Levant.\n\nIn Gallia, the empire of §YSoxony§! faces it's greatest crisis yet, with the various §YSygirdoms§! struggling against the chafing grip of the aging emperor.\n\nIn the Germania, the §YPruthians§! continue to centralize the confederation while the eagle of §YSaxony§! prepares for the great eastern Crusade against the heathens of Turan.\n\nIn the far east of Europe, where the civilized world meets the wild steppes, lies the sons of Guo Hong. The Empire of 10,000 Armies left quite the mark on Eastern Europe, with §YSiescheng§!, the crown jewel, at it's heart. The entire continent is on the verge of major changes, and it will be up to you to lead the §Y[Root.GetAdjective]§! [Root.GovernmentName] through this Aevum Lupi Bicipitis."

string_start_biono_generic: "The Norse peoples of Biono fled their homes in §YZladinia§! a thousand years ago, believing that the end of the world, Ragnarok, had come. In the flight their gods perished, but upon their landing on the verdant shores of Biono they found new ones. Chief among them is §YBaldr§!, son of Odin and the resurrected Lord of Light.\nThey have made new kingdoms, §YSweden§!, §YJutland§!, and more, some of which have fallen to the proselytization of the Christians. However more still stay true to their roots, finding true faith in Baldr.\n\nIn the north of Biono lies a perculiar entity, the §YGanden Union§!. An equal partnership between 4 petty duchies, united in the city of Ganden in 1302. It is not without infighting, but has stood the test of time and looks to be on a path of further centralization. Fully united, they will be a powerful nation indeed.\n\nMoving away from the Norse, the §YBrittanians§! stand as the last remnant of Roman rule in Biono. Formerly united with the kingdom of §YJutland§!, they are on a losing streak and are preparing for a final confrontation with the Swedish which shall determint the fate of Biono.\n\nJust across the pond, the isle of §YScotia§! lies divided. The kingdom of §YScotland§! stands as the almost-supreme ruler of the isle, if not for the meddling §YBelgians§!. Their kingdom has fallen to piracy after the untimely death of the former king. The question now is who shall take the place as hegemon of Biono. Will it fall to Norse ambition, will the Brittanians reclaim their birthright, or shall the Celts drive out the invaders?"

string_start_europe_description: "Europe is home to the §YHoly Italian Empire§!, a large, but largely divided, empire that dominates the §YItalian§! region. Upon the death of an §YEmperor§! the §YElectors§! select his replacement by voting. A member can become an Elector by being granted an Electorate by the current Emperor or inheriting an Elector.\n\nCountries within the Holy Italian Empire are allowed their own diplomacy and can even have their own subjects, but the Emperor is obligated to defend them from outside forces and can demand that they hand back §YUnlawfully Acquired Territory§! within the Empire.\n\nWhile the §YAuthority§! of the Emperor is currently low, this may change if the Emperor can strengthen his hold through §YImperial Reforms§!.\n\n[Root.start_tributaries_descriptions]"
