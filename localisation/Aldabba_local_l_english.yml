Rocked by religious fragmentation and warring political dynasties, each of which claim to be the last sons of the Roman Empire, the people of Hispania wallow in heresy and decadence. We shall move through Iberia like a thundering force, a holy sword that carves flesh with steel as it exices that which is unpure in the land!'\n\nMeanwhile, across the sea, the commanders of the army had a different idea for their [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They saw this as a chance for glory, for redemption: for them, this was their opportunity to showcase how they were truly the heirs of Rome through the rite of war. They saught to launch a campaign with tens of thousands of men to reclaim the peninsula, in a grand and complete struggle for victory.\n\nThe choice presented to [Root.Monarch.GetName] was a complicated one. How should they proceed?"
