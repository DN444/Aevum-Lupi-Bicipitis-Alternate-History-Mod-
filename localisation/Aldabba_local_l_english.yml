They saw this as a chance for glory, for redemption: for them, this was their opportunity to showcase how they were truly the heirs of Rome through the rite of war. They saught to launch a campaign with tens of thousands of men to reclaim the peninsula, in a grand and complete struggle for victory.\n\nThe choice presented to [Root.Monarch.GetName] was a complicated one.
