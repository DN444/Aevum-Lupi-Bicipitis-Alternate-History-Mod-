 fjal.2.desc:0 "The locals speak of monsters and myths that hunt their nights and their homes, while our monsters were wiped out by the Ragnarok, we should have expected that the New World wouldn't have been free from the darkness.\nBut be not afraid, Baldr's Light will cleanse these lands, with the strength of our spirit, we will venture into the woods and come back victorious or be welcomed into Valhalla!\nAll the 'walkers of skin' and the Winteko, the vile flesh-eaters will be slain by the hands of the faithfuls and, whatever you want or not, we will be united in the brotherhood of battle."

 fjal.3.test:0 "Trading, Not Raiding"
 fjal.3.desc:0 "As time marches on, so do our traditions.\nOur ancestors arrived upon this land and acted accordingly, raiding and pillaging.\nHowever there was little to pillage and plenty to hunt instead, farming and fishing became more commonplace.\nTimes of crisis resparked the viking raids but those were resisted by the locals, earning the respect of many warriors.\nTrading fur and meat for iron tools became a lucrative business."

 fjal.4.test:0 "What is in a Name?"
 fjal.4.desc:0 "This land we call Rausulia, for the reddish tint of the southern dirt, and the people who live here are commonly referred as Rausundian.\nThe lack of coastal villages has rendered southern exploration less appealing than in old Europe, but sometimes one ship or two venture too far south and end up shipwrecked.\nOn one such case, the survivors were rescued by the locals and offered by them food and safe rest.\nAfter repairing their ship, after giving their thanks to the locals, they managed to get back to home, bringing these strange animals with them."

 fjal.6.test:0 "Magnusson's Expedition"
 fjal.6.desc:0 "The Njordvik river has always been a great mystery. One of the greatest known rivers, said to rival the Rhine in size and power, yet it's source is unknown. Recently, an explorer by the name of Esben Magnusson came up with the idea of canoeing all the way down to find it's source. He left Haralderfa by the Njordvik on July 6, [GetYear], with a flotilla of nine canoes and 24 men, and a number of Mikmaq guides. Having travelled up the Njordvik for 11 days, they arrived at what is called today Járnlaek Bay on the southern shore of Lake Ontario at the mouth of Járnlaek Creek. They had stumbled upon a vast network of lakes and rivers at the heart of the Rausulian contintent. They had discovered the Great Lakes."
