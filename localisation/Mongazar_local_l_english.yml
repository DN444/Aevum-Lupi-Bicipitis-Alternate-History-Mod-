 mongoland.1.test: "Squatter's Rights"
 mongoland.1.desc: "The city of Araatan was a prosperous trade hub on the mouth of the Vistula. That all ended, however, when the armies of Guo Hong marched through Europe to settle in the ruins. The campaigns of Guo Hong would destroy the Slasmeri coast and depopulate it, so that when the armies of the Mongols settled in their current land they quickly became the majority.\nHowever, now a group of Germanic Balten people have settled among the ruins of Araatan, and are demanding freedom from the harassment of our troops. They have established a city council and are naming their new squatter state 'Rija'. How shall we respond?"
 mongoland.1a: "Those are MY ruins!"
 mongoland.1b: "Freedom!"
