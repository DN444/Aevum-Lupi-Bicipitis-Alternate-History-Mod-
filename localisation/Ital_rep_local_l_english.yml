#####EVENTS


 padan.8.t:0 "What's a Vote Worth?"
 padan.8.d:0 "The power of voting remains the most important part of what a republic truly is.\The issue at hand is who gets to vote, where and how much; the Romans divided the power of legislation between the more noble families and the more wealthy commoners, who often were ignored.\nThe Republic of Padania grew to rely more on the commoners ability to break the mold and innovate, especially the rich ones.\nThe Empire, however, maintained the Senate while the Emperor had a more powerful voice in the legal matters, dealing much faster with crisis and balancing better the various factions of the nation."
 padan.8a:0 "The new Families have enstablished a better net of alliances and power."
 padan.8b:0 "The Republic is for the People, the people with problems and the means to solve them."
 padan.8c:0 "The Consul is the first and last voice to decide on any issue."

 padan.9.t:0 "The Res Publica"
 padan.9.d:0 "A thing for the people.\nThe Republic started when the last king of the Latins was deposed and now the new Republic stands on top of the World.\nBut what of the people, who are they if not the foundation of the Republic own power.\nThe Old Republic would, in times of need, expand citizenship to all those who were in the borders of the Roman lands, but the times have changed.\nWhat would a citizen be in our Republic, what would a Roman be in this era?"
 padan.9a:0 "To be a Citizen is to be Roman."
 padan.9b:0 "To be Roman is to be a Citizen."
 padan.9c:0 "The Roman Republic is our past, now we look to the Future!"
