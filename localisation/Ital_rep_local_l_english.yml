 padan.8.t:0 "What's a Vote Worth?"
 padan.8.d:0 "The power of voting remains the most important part of what a republic truly is.\The issue at hand is who gets to vote, where and how much; the Romans divided the power of legislation between the more noble families and the more wealthy commoners, who often were ignored.\nThe Republic of Padania grew to rely more on the commoners ability to break the mold and innovate, especially the rich ones.\nThe Empire, however, maintained the Senate while the Emperor had a more powerful voice in the legal matters, dealing much faster with crisis and balancing better the various factions of the nation."
 padan.8a:0 "The new Families have enstablished a better net of alliances and power."
 padan.8b:0 "The Republic is for the People, the people with problems and the means to solve them."
 padan.8c:0 "The Consul is the first and last voice to decide on any issue."
